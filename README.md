# About the project
In this project I implement some C functions by myself, thus creating my own library, aiming to get deep in the C language.

# Glossary

These first functions check wheter the argument, which mush have the value of an unsigned char, falls into a certain character class.

#### ft_isalpha();
> checks  for an alphabetic character
#### ft_isdigit();
> checks for a digit (0 through 9)
#### ft_isalnum();
> checks for an alphanumeric character; it is equivalent to (isalpha(c) || isdigit(c)).
#### ft_isascii();
>  checks whether the argument is a 7-bit unsigned char value that  fits  into the ASCII character set.
#### ft_isprint();
> checks for any printable character including space.

#
These functions convert lowercase letters to uppercase, and vice versa.

#### ft_tolower();
#### ft_toupper();
